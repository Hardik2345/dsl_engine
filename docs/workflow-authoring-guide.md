# Workflow Authoring Guide

This document is the repo-accurate reference for creating, editing, validating, running, and scheduling workflows in the DSL engine.

It is based on the current implementation in:

- `server/validation/workflowDefinition.js`
- `server/validation/runContext.js`
- `server/validation/productPartialDayCompatibility.js`
- `engine/WorkflowRunner.js`
- `nodes/*.js`
- `server/routes/workflows.js`
- `server/routes/runs.js`
- `server/routes/schedules.js`
- `scheduler/app/schedulerService.js`

## 1. Mental Model

A workflow is a versioned JSON definition stored in two records:

- `Workflow`: metadata such as `workflowId`, `latestVersion`, `isActive`, `scope`
- `WorkflowVersion`: the concrete `definitionJson` for one version

Execution model:

1. The engine starts at `definition.nodes[0]`
2. It executes one node at a time
3. Each node returns a `status`, optional `delta`, and optional `next`
4. `delta` is merged into the shared execution context
5. Execution stops when there is no `next`, a node terminates, or an error occurs

Important implications:

- The first item in the `nodes` array is the true entrypoint
- There is no separate explicit trigger node in runtime
- Cycles are rejected at runtime
- Nested workflow references are allowed, but capped

## 2. Top-Level JSON Shape

Minimum required fields:

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "wf_example_rca",
  "workflow_type": "root_cause_analysis",
  "version": "1.0",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "alert",
    "alertType": "cvr_drop",
    "brandScope": "single",
    "brandIds": ["brand_a"]
  },
  "nodes": []
}
```

Validation rules:

- `workflow_type` must be exactly `root_cause_analysis`
- `version` is required
- `nodes` must be a non-empty array
- `trigger` must be an object
- `workflow_id` is optional on create; the server auto-generates one if omitted

Server-side trigger normalization during create/version APIs:

- If `trigger.alertType` is missing, it falls back to `trigger.metric` or `default_alert`
- If `trigger.brandScope` is missing:
  - tenant workflows default to `single`
  - global workflows default to `global`
- If `brandScope` is `single` or `multiple` and `brandIds` is empty, the tenant id is injected
- `trigger.type` defaults to `alert`

This means older JSON examples that use `trigger.metric` still work through API creation, but the persisted validated shape should be thought of as `alertType` + `brandScope` + `brandIds`.

## 3. Trigger Rules

Supported trigger semantics in the definition validator:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "alert",
    "alertType": "cvr_drop",
    "brandScope": "single",
    "brandIds": ["tenant_a"]
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `trigger.type`, if provided, must be `alert`
- `trigger.alertType` is required and must be a string
- `trigger.brandScope` must be one of:
  - `single`
  - `multiple`
  - `global`
- `trigger.brandIds` is required for `single` and `multiple`
- `trigger.brandIds` must be empty for `global`

Operational note:

- Trigger matching for event-driven runs is based on tenant/global active workflows and alert matching logic in the scheduler
- Manual runs do not use trigger matching, but the definition must still validate

## 4. Supported Node Types

Allowed node types:

- `validation`
- `metric_compare`
- `branch`
- `recursive_dimension_breakdown`
- `composite`
- `workflow_ref`
- `insight`

Every node must have:

- `id` as a unique string
- `type` as one of the supported values

Runtime limits:

- Total execution steps per run are capped at `100`
- Nested `workflow_ref` depth is capped at `8`

## 5. Node-by-Node Authoring Rules

### 5.1 `validation`

Minimum shape:

```json
{
  "id": "validate",
  "type": "validation",
  "checks": [
    { "field": "sessions", "condition": "current > 0" }
  ],
  "next": "compare"
}
```

Validator requirement:

- `checks` must be a non-empty array

Runtime reality:

- The current node implementation does not interpret `checks`
- It validates `context.meta.tenantId`, `context.meta.metric`, `context.meta.window`, and baseline presence
- It sets:
  - `metrics.data_valid = true`
  - `metrics.baseline_available = true|false`

Authoring advice:

- Keep `checks` populated for schema compatibility and future intent
- Do not rely on the current `checks` array to enforce business validation
- Use `on_fail.action = "terminate"` if failure should stop the workflow cleanly

### 5.2 `metric_compare`

Minimum shape:

```json
{
  "id": "compare",
  "type": "metric_compare",
  "metrics": ["orders", "sessions", "cvr"],
  "next": "route"
}
```

Validator requirement:

- `metrics` must be a non-empty array

Runtime behavior:

- Queries current and baseline aggregates
- Fails if result rows are missing
- Fails if current or baseline sessions are zero
- Writes these metrics into `context.metrics`:
  - `current_orders`, `baseline_orders`
  - `current_sessions`, `baseline_sessions`
  - `current_atc_sessions`, `baseline_atc_sessions`
  - `current_cvr`, `baseline_cvr`
  - `current_atc_rate`, `baseline_atc_rate`
  - `orders_delta_pct`, `sessions_delta_pct`, `atc_sessions_delta_pct`
  - `cvr_delta_pct`, `atc_rate_delta_pct`

Authoring advice:

- Put `metric_compare` before any branch or insight logic that reads delta metrics
- If downstream nodes depend on `cvr_delta_pct`, this node is effectively mandatory

### 5.3 `branch`

Supported rule families:

- Metric rules via `all` and `any`
- Breakdown existence rules via `any_in_breakdowns` or `all_in_breakdowns`
- Breakdown filtering rules via `filter_in_breakdowns`

Simple metric branch example:

```json
{
  "id": "route",
  "type": "branch",
  "rules": [
    {
      "all": [
        { "metric": "sessions_delta_pct", "op": "<", "value": -10 }
      ],
      "then": "breakdown"
    }
  ],
  "default": {
    "then": "insight"
  }
}
```

Validation rules:

- `rules` must be a non-empty array
- Condition `op` must be one of:
  - `>`
  - `>=`
  - `<`
  - `<=`
  - `==`
  - `!=`
- A single rule cannot define more than one of:
  - `any_in_breakdowns`
  - `all_in_breakdowns`
  - `filter_in_breakdowns`

Breakdown rule requirements:

- `dimension` is required
- `conditions` must be a non-empty array
- `limit`, if provided, must be a positive number
- `entry_logic`, if provided, must be `and` or `or`
- `filter_in_breakdowns.mode`, if provided, must be `any` or `all`
- `filter_in_breakdowns.match_scope`, if provided, must be `any` or `all`
- `filter_in_breakdowns.write_matches_to` is required

Runtime behavior worth remembering:

- The branch node requires `context.metrics` to exist
- Metric rules read `context.metrics[condition.metric]`
- Breakdown rules read `context.breakdowns[dimension]`
- On a `filter_in_breakdowns` match:
  - matching entries are written to `delta.breakdowns[write_matches_to]`
  - the first match is also written to `context.scratch.matched_breakdown`
- On an `any_in_breakdowns` match:
  - the matched entry is written to `context.scratch.matched_breakdown`
- If no rule matches and no `default.then` exists, the node fails

Authoring advice:

- Always define a `default.then` unless failure is intentional
- Use `filter_in_breakdowns.write_matches_to` when a later node needs a narrowed evidence set
- Keep condition metric names aligned with outputs from `metric_compare` or breakdown entries

### 5.4 `recursive_dimension_breakdown`

This is the most important authoring surface in the system.

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "source_breakdown",
  "type": "recursive_dimension_breakdown",
  "dimensions": ["utm_source", "utm_medium", "utm_campaign"],
  "base_metric": "cvr",
  "filter_mode": "drop",
  "rank_by": "delta",
  "rank_order": "desc",
  "stop_conditions": {
    "max_depth": 3,
    "min_sessions": 100,
    "min_impact_pct": 5,
    "top_k": 5
  },
  "output_key": "cvr_source_drops"
}
```

Allowed dimensions:

- `product_id`
- `utm_source`
- `utm_medium`
- `utm_campaign`
- `utm_content`
- `utm_term`
- `landing_page_path`
- `landing_page_type`
- `referrer_name`

Validation rules:

- Must define `dimensions` with at least one entry, or legacy `dimension`
- Each dimension must be from the allowed set
- `output_key`, if provided, must be a non-empty string
- `input_scope`, if provided, must be `global` or `breakdown`
- `input_scope = "breakdown"` requires `input_key`
- `input_key` and `output_key` cannot be the same string

Runtime defaults:

- `base_metric` defaults to `cvr`
- `rank_by` defaults to `delta`
- `rank_order` defaults to `desc`
- `filter_mode` defaults to `drop`
- `min_sessions_mode` defaults to `both_low`
- `input_scope` defaults to `global`
- `stop_conditions.max_depth` defaults to `1`
- `stop_conditions.top_k` defaults to `1`

What it does:

1. Runs one breakdown query per recursion level
2. Filters candidates based on session thresholds and metric availability
3. Keeps only drops or increases depending on `filter_mode`
4. Ranks candidates
5. Stores evidence in `context.breakdowns[output_key]`
6. Publishes summary metrics for the top-ranked evidence
7. Recurses by appending dimension filters

Metric behavior:

- For `base_metric = "cvr"`, candidates require valid current and baseline CVR and baseline CVR must be non-zero
- For `base_metric = "atc_rate"`, candidates require valid current and baseline ATC rate and baseline ATC rate must be non-zero
- For `base_metric = "sessions"` or `orders`, the logic does not require valid CVR for candidate inclusion

Threshold behavior:

- `min_sessions_mode = "both_low"` drops candidates only when both current and baseline are below threshold
- `min_sessions_mode = "either_low"` drops if either side is below threshold
- `min_sessions_mode = "baseline_only"` uses only baseline thresholding

Output behavior:

- If `output_key` is omitted, the engine auto-generates one using:
  - metric
  - primary dimension
  - filter mode
- Example generated keys:
  - `cvr_product_id_drops`
  - `orders_utm_campaign_increases`
- The node also emits top evidence metrics such as:
  - `top_dimension`
  - `top_value`
  - `top_display_value`
  - `top_current_sessions`
  - `top_baseline_sessions`
  - `top_current_orders`
  - `top_baseline_orders`
  - `top_cvr_delta_pct`

Important implementation details:

- `min_impact_pct` is accepted in JSON but is not currently enforced in node runtime
- If `output_key` is omitted, the primary dimension key may also be populated for backward compatibility
- `input_scope = "breakdown"` converts existing breakdown entries into one inherited filter:
  - it uses the first breakdown dimension it sees
  - it converts matched values into `operator: "="`
  - multiple values become an array value

Authoring advice:

- Prefer explicit `output_key` names; this makes branching and insight templates more stable
- Use `top_k > 1` only when downstream consumers are prepared for multiple evidence rows
- Treat `min_impact_pct` as documentary only until runtime implements it

### 5.5 `composite`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "root_cause_pack",
  "type": "composite",
  "steps": ["source_breakdown", "campaign_breakdown"],
  "next": "final_insight"
}
```

Validation rule:

- `steps` must be a non-empty array

Runtime behavior:

- Executes each listed step in order
- Merges each step delta into the shared context immediately
- Ignores the child step's own `next` for composite flow control
- After all steps finish, continues to `composite.next`

Critical authoring rule:

- Do not rely on `next` inside nodes that are meant to be composite-only steps
- The composite drives the sequence, not the child node's `next`

### 5.6 `workflow_ref`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "brand_specific_child",
  "type": "workflow_ref",
  "ref": {
    "workflow_id": "shared_breakdown_pack",
    "version": "3.2",
    "scope": "global"
  },
  "next": "final_insight"
}
```

Validation rules:

- `ref` is required
- `ref.workflow_id` is required
- `ref.version` is required
- `ref.scope`, if provided, must be `tenant` or `global`

Runtime behavior:

- Resolves the referenced workflow by tenant + scope rules
- Executes the nested workflow against the same shared context
- Propagates nested termination outward
- Fails if the referenced workflow is inactive or missing
- Detects reference cycles
- Enforces max nested depth `8`

Authoring advice:

- Always pin a version intentionally
- Use `scope: "global"` only when you need to force global resolution
- Remember that referenced workflows mutate the same metrics, breakdowns, filters, and scratch context

### 5.7 `insight`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "final_insight",
  "type": "insight",
  "output_key": "cvr_product_drops",
  "template": {
    "summary": "CVR dropped by {{cvr_delta_pct_fmt}}. Top driver: {{dimension}} = {{value}}.",
    "details": [
      "Segment CVR: {{top_baseline_cvr_pct}} -> {{top_current_cvr_pct}} ({{top_cvr_delta_pct_fmt}})",
      "Sessions: {{top_baseline_sessions}} -> {{top_current_sessions}}"
    ]
  },
  "email": {
    "enabled": true,
    "subject": "Workflow alert for {{brand_name}}",
    "to": ["team@example.com"]
  }
}
```

Validation rules:

- `template` is required and must be an object or string
- `output_key`, if provided, must be a non-empty string
- `email`, if provided, must be an object
- `email.enabled`, if provided, must be boolean
- `email.subject`, if provided, must be a non-empty string
- `email.to`, if provided, must be an array
- If `email.enabled = true`, recipients must pass email validation

Runtime behavior:

- Flattens evidence from breakdowns
- If `output_key` is set, it prioritizes `context.breakdowns[output_key]`
- Otherwise it scans all breakdown evidence
- Prefers `product_id` evidence when available
- Uses `context.scratch.matched_breakdown` as the top evidence if a prior branch populated it
- Writes final result to `context.scratch.finalInsight`
- Writes detail rendering metadata to `context.scratch.finalInsightMeta`
- If `persist` exists, it also sets `context.scratch.persistedInsight`
- If email is enabled, it sends the rendered email and records `context.scratch.finalInsightEmail`
- If `template.details` was configured but every detail row renders empty, email delivery is skipped and `context.scratch.finalInsightEmail.status` is set to `skipped`

Template behavior:

- String templates become `{ summary: "...", details: [] }`
- Missing tokens in `summary` render as `unknown`
- Missing or unknown tokens in `details` cause that detail line to be dropped

Authoring advice:

- Set `output_key` when you want the insight to summarize a specific evidence family
- Keep summary templates resilient to missing tokens
- Use details only for tokens you know are available from prior nodes

### 5.8 `email`

Use a dedicated email node when delivery should be independent from insight generation. Existing `insight.email` configurations remain supported.

Insight example:

```json
{
  "id": "send_insight",
  "type": "email",
  "format": "insight",
  "to": ["team@example.com"],
  "subject": "{{meta.brandName}}: Workflow insight",
  "template": { "insightSource": "scratch.finalInsight" },
  "on_fail": { "action": "terminate", "reason": "Insight email failed" }
}
```

Report example:

```json
{
  "id": "send_report",
  "type": "email",
  "format": "report",
  "to": ["team@example.com"],
  "subject": "{{meta.brandName}}: Daily report",
  "template": {
    "preset": "performance_report_v1",
    "eyebrow": "UTM Source Report",
    "title": "Top & Bottom UTM Sources",
    "description": "Traffic and conversion performance by source.",
    "period": {
      "current": "meta.window",
      "comparison": "meta.baselineWindow"
    },
    "metrics": [
      {
        "label": "Sessions",
        "value": "metrics.current_sessions",
        "change": "metrics.sessions_delta_pct",
        "format": "integer",
        "icon": "sessions"
      }
    ],
    "tables": [
      {
        "title": "Top Sources",
        "source": "breakdowns.top_utm_sources",
        "tone": "positive",
        "limit": 3,
        "columns": [
          { "label": "Source", "path": "display_value", "format": "text" },
          { "label": "CVR", "path": "current.cvr", "format": "percent_ratio" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Binding and runtime behavior:

- Context bindings are safe dot-separated paths; arbitrary expressions and HTML are not evaluated
- Report table sources must already exist as arrays in the run context
- Missing bindings fail the node; existing empty arrays render a `No data available` row
- Supported value formats are `text`, `integer`, `decimal`, `percent_ratio`, `percent`, and `delta_percent`
- Successful deliveries are recorded at `context.scratch.emailDeliveries.<node_id>`
- Dedicated email subjects render exactly as configured; legacy insight emails keep their tenant prefix
- Branding precedence is node override, then tenant `settings.emailBranding`, then platform defaults

## 6. `on_fail` Semantics

Nodes can define:

```json
{
  "on_fail": {
    "action": "terminate",
    "reason": "Human-readable reason"
  }
}
```

Runtime behavior:

- If a node returns `status = "fail"` and `on_fail.action = "terminate"`, the workflow terminates cleanly
- Otherwise the run throws and is marked failed

Use this when:

- No-data conditions are expected and should stop analysis without being treated as operational failure

## 7. Execution Context Contract

Manual run context must be an object with:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "tenantId": "brand_a",
    "metric": "cvr",
    "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata",
    "window": {
      "start": "2026-03-26 00:00:00",
      "end": "2026-03-27 00:00:00"
    },
    "baselineWindow": {
      "start": "2026-03-25 00:00:00",
      "end": "2026-03-26 00:00:00"
    }
  },
  "filters": [],
  "metrics": {},
  "rootCausePath": [],
  "scratch": {}
}
```

Validation rules:

- `context.meta` is required
- `context.meta.tenantId` is required
- `context.meta.timezone` is resolved by the server and must be a supported IANA timezone
- `context.meta.window.start/end` are required
- `context.meta.baselineWindow.start/end` are required
- `baselineWindow.type` is explicitly not allowed
- Both windows must:
  - be valid SQL datetime strings
  - be hour-aligned
  - have `end > start`

Accepted datetime style:

- `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
- `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`

Required alignment:

- minutes must be `00`
- seconds must be `00`

Rerun note:

- `POST /runs` with `rerun: true` floors window and baseline endpoints down to the hour before validation

## 8. Merge Semantics

Every node writes a `delta`, which is merged by `MergeContext`.

Merge rules:

- `meta` is immutable and cannot be merged
- `filters` append
- `metrics` shallow-merge by key
- `rootCausePath` appends
- `scratch` is overwritten, not deep-merged
- `breakdowns[key]` appends to existing arrays

Critical implication:

- Multiple nodes writing `scratch` can replace each other's values unless they preserve prior fields themselves
- Breakdown arrays accumulate over time; they are not replaced

## 9. Partial-Day Analysis Rules

This is the most important limitation area when authoring workflows.

### 9.1 What counts as partial-day

A window is partial-day when:

- it is hour-aligned
- but it is not midnight-to-midnight across a whole number of days
- its boundaries have first been normalized into `context.meta.timezone`

Examples:

- `2026-03-27 00:00:00` to `2026-03-27 13:00:00` is partial-day
- `2026-03-26 00:00:00` to `2026-03-27 00:00:00` is full-day

### 9.2 Special routing paths

The query layer has three behaviors:

1. Partial-day `product_id`
2. Partial-day `landing_page_path`
3. Default daily path

Partial-day special handling exists only for:

- `product_id`
- `landing_page_path`

Everything else falls back to daily analysis logic.

### 9.3 Partial-day `product_id` constraints

For partial-day windows:

- only `product_id` filters are supported safely
- workflows are rejected if `product_id` appears after unsupported dimensions in a reachable recursive path

Invalid example:

```json
{
  "type": "recursive_dimension_breakdown",
  "dimensions": ["utm_source", "product_id"],
  "stop_conditions": { "max_depth": 2 }
}
```

Why invalid:

- partial-day product analysis cannot safely run after UTM dimensions

Valid fixes:

- put `product_id` first
- or reduce `max_depth` so the `product_id` level is never reached

### 9.4 Partial-day `landing_page_path` constraints

For partial-day windows:

- only `product_id` filters are supported safely
- `landing_page_path` can be first
- or it can be preceded only by `product_id`
- it cannot be preceded by UTM or referrer dimensions

Invalid examples:

- `utm_source -> landing_page_path`
- `utm_campaign -> landing_page_path`
- `referrer_name -> landing_page_path`

Valid example:

- `product_id -> landing_page_path`

### 9.5 Root filter constraints

If a manual run context includes `filters`, then for partial-day runs:

- partial-day product analysis rejects any filter dimension other than `product_id`
- partial-day landing-page analysis also rejects any filter dimension other than `product_id`

Practical consequence:

- A workflow that works for full-day windows can still be rejected for partial-day windows because of run filters or recursive dimension ordering

### 9.6 Authoring recommendations for partial-day-safe workflows

- Put `product_id` first if the workflow may ever be run on hourly windows
- Put `landing_page_path` first, or only after `product_id`
- Avoid UTM-first recursive chains if you expect partial-day execution
- Keep root filters to `product_id` for hourly-compatible runs

## 10. Schedules and Window Modes

Schedules are separate records attached to a workflow.

Schedule payload fields:

- `cronExpr`
- `timezone`
- `windowMode`
- `overlapPolicy`
- `retryPolicy`
- `isActive`
- `name`

Supported `windowMode` values:

- `previous_complete_day`
- `day_to_date_vs_previous_day`

### 10.1 `previous_complete_day`

If a scheduled run fires on March 27 in the schedule timezone:

- `window` = March 26 00:00 to March 27 00:00
- `baselineWindow` = March 25 00:00 to March 26 00:00

This mode is safest for daily workflows.

### 10.2 `day_to_date_vs_previous_day`

If a scheduled run fires at 13:37 local time:

- `window` = today 00:00 to today 13:00
- `baselineWindow` = yesterday 00:00 to yesterday 13:00

Important implementation details:

- Minutes are truncated to the top of the hour
- The current partial hour is excluded
- This mode intentionally produces partial-day windows

Critical edge case:

- If this mode fires at local hour `00`, then both windows become zero-length:
  - `00:00` to `00:00`
- That is not a useful analysis window and would fail manual run validation
- Avoid midnight cron schedules for `day_to_date_vs_previous_day`

Practical recommendation:

- Use top-of-hour daytime schedules for this mode, for example `0 8-23 * * *`

## 11. Cron Expression Support

Cron support is custom and expects exactly 5 fields:

- minute
- hour
- day
- month
- weekday

Supported forms in each field:

- `*`
- `*/n`
- `a-b`
- comma-separated explicit integers

Notable limitation:

- Validation is minimal and custom, not full cron-parser compatibility
- If you need unusual cron syntax, verify it against the implementation before relying on it

## 12. Overlap Policies

Supported overlap policies on schedules and queued runs:

- `queue_one_pending`
- `skip_if_running`
- `allow_parallel`

Behavior:

- `allow_parallel`: always queue
- `skip_if_running`: skip if an active run exists
- `queue_one_pending`: if a run is active:
  - queue one deferred run if none is pending
  - otherwise skip additional triggers

Use `queue_one_pending` as the safe default for expensive workflows.

## 13. Versioning and Scope

### 13.1 Tenant vs global

Workflow scope can be:

- tenant
- global

Resolution rules:

- Tenant workflow lookup happens first
- Global lookup is used as fallback when allowed
- `workflow_ref.scope = "tenant"` disables global fallback

### 13.2 Version creation

When creating a new version:

- `definition.workflow_id` must match the route `:workflowId`
- The new version becomes `latestVersion`
- If `definition.name` is present, workflow display name is updated too

Authoring advice:

- Treat versions as immutable snapshots
- Use explicit semantic version strings like `1.0`, `1.1`, `2.0`
- When using `workflow_ref`, decide whether child workflows should be pinned or updated intentionally

## 14. Runtime Failure Modes to Remember

Common reasons a workflow fails:

- node id missing or duplicated
- unsupported node type
- branch rule has no default and nothing matches
- metric compare returns no rows
- metric compare gets zero current or baseline sessions
- recursive breakdown has no valid dimension
- recursive breakdown with `input_scope = "breakdown"` cannot find `input_key`
- workflow reference is missing, inactive, or cyclic
- execution exceeds step limit
- partial-day compatibility validation rejects the run

## 15. Practical Authoring Checklist

- Start the `nodes` array with the real entrypoint node
- Always include `workflow_type = "root_cause_analysis"`
- Give every node a unique `id`
- Put `metric_compare` before any node that branches on global deltas
- Always give `branch` a `default.then`, unless a failure is desired
- Use explicit `output_key` values on breakdown nodes
- Keep `composite.steps` authoritative; do not rely on child `next`
- Pin `workflow_ref.version` intentionally
- Remember that `scratch` overwrites, while `breakdowns` append
- Design recursive dimensions to be safe for partial-day if the workflow may run hourly
- Avoid midnight schedules with `day_to_date_vs_previous_day`

## 16. Good Example

  },

        {
          "all": [
            { "metric": "cvr_delta_pct", "op": "<", "value": -10 }
          ],
          "then": "product_breakdown"
        }
      ],
      "default": {
        "then": "final_insight"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "product_breakdown",
      "type": "recursive_dimension_breakdown",
      "dimensions": ["product_id", "landing_page_path"],
      "base_metric": "cvr",
      "filter_mode": "drop",
      "output_key": "cvr_product_drops",
      "stop_conditions": {
        "max_depth": 2,
        "min_sessions": 100,
        "top_k": 5
      },
      "next": "final_insight"
    },
    {
      "id": "final_insight",
      "type": "insight",
      "output_key": "cvr_product_drops",
      "template": {
        "summary": "CVR changed by {{cvr_delta_pct_fmt}}. Top driver: {{dimension}} = {{value}}.",
        "details": [
          "Segment CVR: {{top_baseline_cvr_pct}} -> {{top_current_cvr_pct}} ({{top_cvr_delta_pct_fmt}})",
          "Sessions: {{top_baseline_sessions}} -> {{top_current_sessions}}",
          "Orders: {{top_baseline_orders}} -> {{top_current_orders}}"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Why this example is safe:

- valid top-level contract
- explicit entrypoint
- branch has a default path
- breakdown is partial-day compatible because `product_id` is first
- insight targets an explicit evidence key

## 17. Things That Look Supported But Are Not Fully Implemented

These are the main footguns when reading only the JSON:

- `validation.checks` exist in schema, but runtime validation does not interpret them yet
- `recursive_dimension_breakdown.stop_conditions.min_impact_pct` is accepted but not enforced in runtime
- `insight.persist` is not true DB persistence; the actual persistent insight record comes from final run persistence logic after execution
- Trigger examples using `metric`, `condition`, and `window` are legacy-style inputs, not the canonical validator contract

## 18. Suggested Workflow Creation Process

1. Start from the trigger shape and decide tenant/global scope
2. Define the entrypoint node first because runtime uses array order
3. Add `metric_compare` early if any later logic depends on deltas
4. Add branch logic with a guaranteed default path
5. Add breakdown nodes with explicit `output_key`s
6. Review recursive dimensions for partial-day compatibility
7. Add insight nodes with only the tokens you know upstream nodes produce
8. Create the workflow
9. Test one full-day manual run
10. Test one partial-day manual run if the workflow may be scheduled hourly
11. Only then attach schedules
